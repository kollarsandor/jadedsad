# Overview

JADED (Deep Discovery AI Platform) is a comprehensive polyglot fabric architecture that combines advanced AI capabilities with cutting-edge scientific computing. The platform integrates multiple programming languages and paradigms to deliver sophisticated services including protein structure prediction (AlphaFold 3), formal verification systems, quantum-resistant security, and real-time data visualization. Built with a microservices architecture, JADED orchestrates complex computational workflows across distributed systems while maintaining type safety and mathematical correctness through formal methods.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Design Pattern**: Single-page application with progressive web app (PWA) capabilities
- **UI Framework**: Custom glass-morphism design system with Aurora background effects

## Backend Architecture
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Python-based FastAPI coordinator (`coordinator.py`) that routes requests to specialized language services
- **Microservices**: Each programming language runs as an independent service with dedicated responsibilities:
  - Julia: AlphaFold 3 protein structure prediction and scientific computing
  - Elixir: Distributed computing gateway with OTP supervision trees
  - Clojure: Metaprogramming and genome analysis
  - Nim: High-performance native operations and GCP integration
  - Zig: Low-level utilities and memory management
  - Prolog: Logic programming and symbolic reasoning
  - J Language: Statistical computing and array programming
  - Pharo: Interactive visualization and object-oriented programming
  - Haskell: Type-safe protocols and functional programming bindings
  - Pony: Actor-based federated learning systems

## Polyglot Fabric Design
- **Layered Architecture**: 
  - Layer 0: Formal verification (Lean 4, TLA+, Coq, Isabelle/HOL)
  - Layer 1: Metaprogramming (Clojure, Scheme)
  - Layer 2: Runtime core (Julia, Python)
  - Layer 3: Concurrency (Elixir/Erlang OTP)
  - Layer 4: Native performance (Nim, Zig, ATS)
  - Layer 5: Special paradigms (Prolog, Pharo)
- **Inter-Service Communication**: RESTful APIs with JSON message passing
- **Type Safety**: Haskell-based protocol definitions ensure type safety across language boundaries
